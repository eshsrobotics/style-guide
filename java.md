This style guide will be finished later. For now, just format your code using [Artistic Style](http://astyle.sourceforge.net/) with `astylerc` found in the [dotfiles](https://github.com/eshsrobotics/dotfiles) repository.

Quality Over Functionality
--------------------------

Make your code beautiful and eloquent before making it functional. Your code is everyone's code, so make it good!


Braces
------

Braces should always go on the next line.

    public void myMethod()
    {
    }

not

    public void myBadMethod() {
    }


Indentation
-----------

Always use four spaces for indentation. Do NOT use tabs or any other amount of space.

        public void myMethod()
        {
        }
